# GameStack Overview

GameStack is a multi-platform library for building interactive media and gaming
applications for iOS, Android, Mac, and Linux. It is as much a conglomeration of
other open source libraries as it is original tools and resources. GameStack
brings many technologies together that would otherwise have to be obtained
separately and integrated.

GameStack's primary focus is on the developer. It uses a code-first approach and
is aimed at maximum flexibility and control for the app developer, rather than
forcing developers to work within a rigid structure dictated by design tools.

The primary dependency for mobile development is Xamarin Studio. GameStack views
can be mixed with native mobile controls using Xamarin's bindings. In this way,
GameStack can be used to augment mobile apps, but developers retain control of
the main loop.

GameStack can be used on Mac and Linux without Xamarin Studio, but we recommend
MonoDevelop for most scenarios.
